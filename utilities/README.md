## keyword_parser.py

Given a folder (user prompt) of DOCX files which contain research symposium abstracts and keywords, this utility parses all of the listed keywords from the documents and arranges them into a CSV file.

#### Sample output:

*doc1.docx , bryophyte*

*doc1.docx, fern*

*doc2.docx, fern*

*doc2.docx, dna*

*doc3.doc, NOT A DOCX FILE*

*doc4.docx, NO KEYWORDS FOUND*
