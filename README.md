# Beth McDonald portfolio

## Overview
This repo was created to showcase some of the code I've written, mainly in Python and Java.

### API Work
`PYTHON, API, FILE OUTPUT`.  This program interfaces with an API and does a series of calculations to automate a previously tedious administrative process.

### Hidden Markov Model
`JAVA, FILE INPUT`.  This is a simple program that calculates state probability using Hidden Markov Models.  Emissions and transition probability tables are inputted in tab-delimited files (specified in the program header). The user inputs initial states and observations/sensor values. The program then calculates and displays the most likely state for each time interval.

### Programming 2 Teaching Materials
`JAVA, JAVAFX, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS`.  These are two simple programs written in JavaFX, and created for Java Programming II students (CS-207).  These project reinforce programming concepts (inheritance, polymorphism, working with objects, etc.) through hands-on coding and research, and help students develop the skills to use programming documentation and prepare research in small teams.  Students are given a partially written codebase and are guided toward completing the programs, and develop basic tests.

### Utilities
`PYTHON, FILE PARSING, FILE INPUT, FILE OUTPUT`.  Simple tool to extract keywords from a long list of academic conference abstracts.
