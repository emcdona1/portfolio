## Overview
This repo was created to showcase some of the code I've written. I mainly work with Java, but am also learning how to write Python scripts for the purpose of working with datasets (ETL, exploratory analysis, and eventually visualization).

### Hangman Research Lab
A simple hangman game written in JavaFX, and created for Java Programming II students (CS-207). The project allows students to practice working with inheritance and polymorphism and to understand some applications of these principles. Students are given a partially written codebase and are guided to complete the program using the Java API documentation, and to consider how they can test their program.

### Image Processing Research Lab
A simple JavaFX program that manipulates a JPG image, created for Java Programming II students (CS-207). This project was originally written in Swing, and my task was to rewrite the program in JavaFX and to overhaul the assignment to better target the learning objectives. The project allows students to practice manipulating 2D arrays, start to work with objects and methods, and to understand how to use the Java API documentation.
Students are given a partially written codebase -- this is the first time they see an event-driven program within the curriculum, so one goal is to make them feel comfortable with writing new code within an unknown environment. Students are guided to complete the program by both using API-defined methods and creating simple methods (e.g. image flip, rotate, grayscale).
