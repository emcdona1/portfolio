# Image Processing Research Lab

## Learning Objectives
- Increase comfort with referencing the Java documentation
- Review manipulation of 2D arrays
- Create a class
- Give initial exposure to concepts in future classes, including: Event-driven programming, JavaFX, objects/classes, inheritance
- Provide guided practice for how to break down a larger software problem into multiple steps

## Student Activities
Examine the DisplayImages class -- use Java API documentation to understand the basics of the Application class, be able to scan given codebase for general understanding.

Create the ManipulatedImage class to the specifications of the DisplayImages class -- learn how to infer method parameters and return type from given code. Practice searching a Java class' documentation for a method that meets the programmer's needs.

Outline a class without defining methods.

Use 2D arrays which contain objects (they typically have only filled arrays with primitives in previous coursework), and traverse arrays in different orders.

Describe in written English what a piece of code does.

## Contents
Solution code, which was provided to student peer leaders for reference (in case of unclear/ambiguous written instructions, to show one potential "correct" solution).

- animals.jpg - The image file to be manipulated.
- DisplayImages.java - JavaFX application which displays the image and each manipulated version of the image.
- ManipulatedImage.java - Class stores a 2D array of the image's pixels, so the students can practice manipulating the array in various ways. Students also creat constructors, getter/setter methods, and instance variables.
